# hello-world

it is my first repository

Hi human!

Diego here. I'd like to take part in the development of Cesium, which is an open source Javascript library for 3D visualization on virtual globe using WebGL. I also want to learn about threeJs, which is a high-level API for WebGL. I hope I can find out some problems in the process of learning. Do some experiments to verify or negate my speculations and commit an article to best journals.
